# GrassHopper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nitnelave/hopper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nitnelave/hopper) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nitnelave/hopper/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nitnelave/hopper?branch=master)

GrassHopper is a programming language that aims to do what C++ does, but
better. In other words, we aim to be to C++ what Kotlin is to Java.

Among the objectives of the language:
  - Fun to write
  - As expressive as C++ (ability to control low-level aspects)
  - Less dangerous than C++
  - Easier to write meta-programming
  - Relatively easy to learn (especially after C++).

Among the non-objectives:
  - Conceptually pure/beautiful language
    We're not trying to make a nice abstract language, but a down-to-earth,
    practical one that is fun to write.
  - Full memory safety
    We don't want the user to deal with the complexity of Rust's
    reference-borrowing.
  - Retro-compatibility
    This is a brand-new language, not C++++.

This language is still very much a work in progress. The grammar and list of
features is likely to change a lot before it is stable.

Document with the features we would like to include:

If you want to contribute, feel free to contact us! We are in need of developer
workforce.
